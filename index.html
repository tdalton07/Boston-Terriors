	<h1>Boston Terriers</h1>
<p>The Boston Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United States of America. This <i>"American Gentleman"</i> was accepted in 1893 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club">American Kennel Club</a> as a non-sporting breed.<sup>[2]</sup> Color and markings are important when distinguishing this breed from the AKC standard. They should be either black, brindle or seal with white markings.<sup>[3]</sup> Bostons are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent and very easily trained. They are friendly and can be stubborn at times. The average life span of a Boston is around 11 to 13 years, though some can live up to around 18 years. They have a short nose, which can often cause breathing problems later in life, which is what leads to a low life expectancy.</p>
<p>
The American Kennel Club ranked the Boston Terrier as the 21st most popular breed in 2019.</p>
